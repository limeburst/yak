Title: Feeds

Brent Simmons has a [good article](http://inessential.com/2011/06/15/what_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_rs) on feeds.

Now some boring stuff.

There are two significant feed formats, ATOM and RSS. Until today, I thought RSS was better than ATOM as a format. Because to my eyes, it was the most commonly seen word. But looking at the specifications, it turned out that RSS sucks(as a format).

So ATOM will be the default feed format for this project.
