Title: Page Titles

Page titles are important because they convey the critical information of 'what this page is about' and 'what site this page belongs to'. I've looked at the page titles of a few blogs, and most of the sane ones fall into these formats;

* Blog Name » Page Title
* Blog Name: Post Title
* Post Title | Blog Name
* Post Title — Blog Name

I've thought about exposure priority, decoration preferences, and some other things, but it turns out that there are [proper uses for dashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash), especially the em dash.

TL;DR;  
Use the em dash, like this: Post Title — Blog Name
