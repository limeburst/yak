Title: Markdown

WYSIWYG was a lie.

* You get much more than what you see. Unnecessarily generated markup that is longer than your writing.
* You lose all you see. Poor WYSIWYG editors sometimes screw up and decides to throw away all your writings.
* You totally get what you see. HTML-color for emphasis? Really?

And to quote Brian Kernighan,

> The problem with ‘What You See Is What You Get’ is that what you see is all you’ve got.

WYSIWYG may seem easy to use, but they are a mess. In my opinion, [John Gruber's Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a much better solution for blogging. It adds semantics with minimum markup and mental load.
