Title: The Blogging Tool

Tools are tools. If you want to write on the web, the only important thing is really, your passion to write.

But I, as a programmer, have never liked any of the blogging tools all the people are using. Wordpress is too heavy, I've seen too much of those blogs get fireballed. Tumblr is pretty but its permalinks are not, and there is too much downtime. etc etc etc.

So I've resisted my desire to write just because there is no publishing platform I like. It's been like that for three years, and here I am, regretting, still wondering why there isn't this simple tool I need.

That's it. Fuck waiting. I'm a goddamn programmer and I'll write my own.
