Title: The Static Dream

When I was a little kid, I looked at the all-so-mighty Yahoo! and thought how the news headlines changed every time I hit refresh.

> Is there someone at Yahoo who updates the index HTML file every second?

What a musing.

Serving dynamic content like that must be really slow. It's ironic that the slowness is still the case these days.

A blog doesn't need to be dynamic. Why not serve blog posts as static content? That way my writings won't end up in some cryptic database. Put those on a ramdisk and the bottleneck is the so-wide 100Mb/s home internet connection(in the case of Korea). Even better, with SSDs, we don't even need caching.

So my blog will be static. I need a static blog generator. A blog baking engine.
