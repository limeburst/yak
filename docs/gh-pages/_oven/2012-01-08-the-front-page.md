Title: The Front Page

What should be on the front page of a blog?

* The name of the author
* Recent posts
* Pagination?
* Link to archives

Read my short thoughts on names [here](http://yak.limelog.net/2011/12/05/names/).

Recent posts. But how recent? I think 20 is enough. Should we paginate? But how many people click on those tiny numbers? I never did. If the first 20 posts I see are good, that blog deserves to be in my feed list.

Links to archives.  For how long of a time of posts should each archive keep? A month? A year? It depends on the writer, so I'll let them choose.
