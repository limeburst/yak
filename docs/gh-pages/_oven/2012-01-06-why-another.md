Title: Why Another?

Tom Preston-Werner, the cofounder of GitHub, wrote [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a blog-aware static site generator, for the whole GitHub community to use.

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is another static blog generator based on Jekyll by Brandon Mathis.

Brent Simmons, the author of [inessential.com](http://inessential.com/), uses his own static blog generator.

[Movable Type](http://movabletype.org/)'s default mode is static.

Yesterday, Marco Arment released his static blog generator [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack).

I bet there are bunch of other static blog generators out there. Hell, that's a lot of static generator for blogs. Why bother making another?

Because none above fit my exact needs. And well, some programmers like yak shaving.
