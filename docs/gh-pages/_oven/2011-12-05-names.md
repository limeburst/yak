Title: Names

To me, the author's name is important.

To others, the presence of a name shows that the author is taking responsibilities, and people get a feeling of authencity from the writings.

To the author himself, it is an oath to self, to be who one is, no more, no less. You *will* feel a sense of futility if you don't use your real name. Do not fear to be wrong. Nobody is right. Everyone is wrong.
